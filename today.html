        <p>
            My heart’s racing, mind is empty and hands turned numb (in a good way) even with the mere thought of writing something about you. You know how I feel about you and what is your importance in my life, but on this special occasion, I’ll still try to convey my thoughts and feelings for you. <br><br>
            It is not possible to describe you with words, those webpages ahead might have given a tiny hint to you (I tried my best to do so). You are the most playful, adorable, cute and lovable character in the movie of my life. The lead character; the one around whom whole story revolves around. I’m comfortably happy to be outcasted in the movie of my life by You because I am You and You are Me. <br><br>
            Today, a part of me was born. So, it is one of the most important days for me. You complete me, you fill up every void of imperfections within me, you are the best one for me, you are the only one for me. You find the gaps in me and pour your awesomeness into it to make me a better person.  To sum up, I’m just for you and you’re just for me.<br><br>
            Your cute smile is the primary reason for me to live and love life. I cherish every moment thinking and knowing that you’re by my side; holding hands; supporting; and will remain the same forever. Your sparkling face makes my life bright; leaving not a single patch of darkness behind. Whatever the matter, wherever the place, you can always bring up smile to my face and happiness to my soul. Your happiness is infectious; whenever you’re around me, all of a sudden, the mood lightens, the heart softens and it genuinely feels like love is in the air. (Pardon me if that’s too cringy)<br><br>
            In every step, at every passing moment, I think of you and just you. I think of what you’ve done for me, what you could do for me, what I can do for you and how we’ll remain happy for life. Just when I think what more can I get, what else do I need, I’m lucky and happy to have all I have, then you come up with something more beautiful than even imagined before and put it in our lives. And I’m pretty sure you’ll continue this all way along. 
            Today, on the occasion of your birthday, let us remember and revisit our memories since we’ve known each other. It has been a bit more than a year but what a journey it has been.<br><br> From :
            <br><br>
            <i>

            -	Nice guess, even in drunk situation.<br><br>

            To:<i><br><br>

        </i>
            We’ve come a long way.<br><br>
            The first time we met, it was a nice and pleasurable meeting between the two strangers. You barely talked in the beginning and I began to provide evidence to my initial impression that you were a girl with a high attitude. But soon enough, I was happy to know that I was wrong and you were the most friendly and wonderful person ever. The way you talked, the way you laughed, smiled and shared stories, you took away a piece of my heart that very day.<br><br>
            Gradually, we began to talk. I liked talking to you and felt like you did too. We’d talk for hours and hours about a lot of things; relevant or not. You shared your life with me and so did I. Time went on really quick until we realized that we had become inseparable and would not be able to stay without each other. We complemented each other so well that we always reached out to one another even for no reason. Maybe that’s what’s called the beginning of love; such a pleasant one we experienced. <br><br>
            Then we would go to different places together, enjoy the day, enjoy the company and return with memories. We were friends but what we had in between was way above and beyond friendship. You cared for me for the minor of things, which would be ignored by almost everyone (you still do). You taught me to be a better human; to help other; to not be arrogant; to take care of myself. And without any objection or any resistance, I followed you; with a smile on my face. I did everything you told me to (except for once; sorry) and it was all good.<br><br>
            Okay, the build up is enough now, let’s go to the day we finally got together. After a lot of problems and complications, we found our path towards each other; the day we inaugurated our love. Among the beautiful hills, with great scenery, on a chill weather, at dusk; extremely romantic as in movies; we expressed ourselves. How could I even try to explain that feeling, let us leave it here, you know I know. <br><br>
            After all that, how could we ever turn around or look back? We just kept and kept on moving forward, being the supportive pillar for one another and this journey isn’t coming to an end. We have faced problems, we’ve made mistakes, we’ve disappointed each other, but never stopped loving one another. Maybe that’s what’s required to remain in love; to find a way to keep loving, always. <br><br>
            A famous writer said, “It’s easy to fall in love but difficult to remain in love.”<br><br>
            Yeah it’s difficult, but equally interesting and lovely. To have a person who can blindly count on you and call you yours is a blessing not everyone gets. Someone to share happiness as well as sorrow, the problems as well as solutions, the smiles as well as tears, the ups as well as downs, the feeling is actually divine. <br><br>
            There are so many things to remember. The Kirtipur’s magical aura, the Shivapuri’s bliss, the Dhulikhel’s welcome, the Ranikot’s view, the Nagarkot’s beauty, the Ekantakuna’s laphing (where we met the first), the Garden of Dreams, the Gundu’s tea, the Siddhapokhari’s calmness, the Bhaktapur’s hot chocolate, the Thamel’s candel light, the Narayan Dai and Delicious momo, the hot sausage (hehe), the Lucifer’s world, the Vampire’s acts, the Budhanilkantha’s blessings, the Dakshinkali’s worship, the Swayambhu’s eyes, and so many more . . . (I’ve a few in mind but tired of thinking more, I could go on and on just writing this)<br><br>
            All these times, all these memories, leading up to this moment, the moment where I am finally able to say, <br><br>
            “HAPPY BIRTHDAY, My Woman ❤❤”<br><br>
            May God always bless you with peace and happiness and prosperity. May you accomplish everything you’ve wished and lead a happy life. And most importantly, may God let me play a part in it for life; for a long time. I shall always remain by your side and give my best just to light you up, cause you light up my home, dreams and life. I shall ever hold your hands tight and protect you from any upcoming troubles and problems like a shield. You are the most beautiful thing ever happened to me. Always stay cheerful, may you get allll the happiness and love you deserve. You’re the best person one can have and you’re mine. <br><br>
            Cherish this moment of turning old, HAPPY BIRTHDAY !!!!<br><br>
            May you thrive with all the energy in the Universe ❤❤❤❤❤❤<br><br>
